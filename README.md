## Usage

To start the quiz press the start button. Each player starts with a score of 75. If the answer provided is incorrect then the time spent on that question is deducted from the score. If the answer provided is correct, then the time spent on the question is not deducted from the score. A bottom textbox appears after choosing an answer and states whether the chosen answer for the question is correct. The current score is shown at the top left of the page. All scores are logged in the local storage of the browser and are retained until the "Clear Scores" button is pressed. The top 10 scores are displayed. After saving the score, the user is directed to the start screen to try again.
